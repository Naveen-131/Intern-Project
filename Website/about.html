<h2>Job</h2>

<button class="job">How should I apply for jobs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Apply directly for the position you’re interested in from our current listings. Please make sure you qualify for the role before applying. It’s okay to 
apply for positions in multiple offices, but applying for positions you do not qualify for won’t increase your chances, and will likely raise a red flag within
the recruiting team. For design applicants, it’s important to include a PDF orURL of your portfolio for easy sharing of files.</p>
  </div>

<button class="job">How does the recruiting process work?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We have a small recruiting team who manages job listings, reads incoming applications, determines fit, and coordinates the interview and offer processes.  The interview process can often include multiple interviews.You should be ready to share examples of your work and passion areas to help us get a sense of who you are beyond your resume. </p>
  </div>

<button class="job">How much experience do I need?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> We hire people with a wide range of professional experience and educational background, as we know that bringing diverse perspectives is crucial to making positive, disproportionate impact in the world. Some roles call for seasoned professionals, while others have more flexibility to bring on less experienced candidates. Either way, we’ve designed systems that allow our community to learn, grow, and thrive. Degrees are important for some roles, but we aim to keep our community as diverse as the challenges we work on.</p>
 </div>
 
 <button class="job">How come I didn’t get an interview?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We receive numerous applications for our open positions. Hiring Administrators select candidates to interview based on their strength of application using job-based criteria. You will receive a call or an email only if you are chosen for an interview. If you did not receive some sort of communication, you were unfortunately not selected for an interview. If you provided an email in your application you will receive an email notice if you are forwarded to the Hiring Administrator but are not selected for an interview.</p>
 </div>
 
<button class="job">Will you contact me regarding the status of my application?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> Because we receive thousands of resumes, we can’t  personally reply to each submission. Your application will be reviewed, and someone on the recruiting team will 
  reach out directly if they’d like to schedule an interview. Should your application match the role requirements (or otherwise inspire us), you will likely hear 
  from someone in recruiting within a month of applying. Whether or not you hear from us, your application will remain on file for potential future openings. </p>
